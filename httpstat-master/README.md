httpstat is a **single file🌟** Python script that has **no dependency👏** and is compatible with **Python 3🍻**.


## Installation

There are three ways to get `httpstat`:

- Download the script directly: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reorx/httpstat/master/httpstat.py`

- Install through pip: `pip install httpstat`

- Install through homebrew (macOS only): `brew install httpstat`


## Usage

In the original file ,users have to type in 

HTTPSTAT_SHOW_BODY=true 

to show the body of the url they typed in , but in this modified version , the body are shown automatically

Also, by seting the show_spped=true, we can automatically show the down_load and up_load spped.

P.s Now i can use Github fluently and are trying some new things. I will update my file later.
